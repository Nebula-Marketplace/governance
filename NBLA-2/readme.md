Nebula is building to be a safe-haven for creators and collectors alike. This proposal seeks to decide if royalties should be enforced on the Nebula platform 

## The what
Royalties are always a tricky topic, as its money post-mint going to the creators pockets (usually). 
Full enforcement requires users to pay the standard 7.5% (on average. not all projects use this) on top of the list price.
Partial enforcement would allow users to pay either half or all of the standard royalty SFBP (Seller fee basis points) 
No enforcement would put royalties in the trader's hands. You pick None, half, or full.

## Options
0: Abstain
1: Full enforcement (always 100%)
2: Partial enforcement (between 50% and 100%)
3: No enforcement (user choice)
